# celesteisle.github.io

This repository is an index of game knowledge for the Celeste isle dnd campaign.
It contains player versus character knowledge distinctions;
Rules for custom mechanics (i.e. weapons and previously encountered creatures);
Maps of the world;
Character journals/notes;
Party information;
Other resources as needed on a case-by-case basis.

This site was a personal torture project because I decided to store data as XML and parse that manually using JS. It is incredibly outdated and incredibly shaky.
