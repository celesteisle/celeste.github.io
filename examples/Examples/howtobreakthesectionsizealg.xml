<!-- This will cause a row break with no filling because the calculated target size will be 12 / 2 = 6 -->
<!-- This means div 1 will have a width of '6' and div 2 will have a width of '7'-->
<!-- because 6 + 7 > 12, the algoithm will make a new row for the second div and have it fill out the remainder of the row-->
<!--but the first div will only fill 1/2 a row-->
