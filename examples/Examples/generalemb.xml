<!-- General Embedding Example
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––– -->
<!-- Just follow html rules, and for multiple embeds use the divider rules established in multilists.emb -->
<!--You need a root divider element -->
<div>
    <!--any styling should be done on an interior divider element -->
    <!-- no this is not a violation of seperation of presentation vs. data 
    b/c the color is used to make different data distinct, and is an inherent part of the data -->
    <div class="twelve columns section div lightblue">
        <p> put whatever you wanna embed inside</p>
    </div>
</div>
<!-- make sure to add your file to the registry file in its respective content folder, or the dynamic populator script won't be able to load it -->
<!-- have fun you summabitch -->
